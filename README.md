# Blood-Cell-Subtype-Classification-with-CNNs-for-Diagnostic-Precision
To identify these blood cell subtypes, here are some key distinguishing features that can guide an image-based classification model:

1. **Basophils**:
   - Granules are large, dark blue or purple, often obscuring the nucleus.
   - Comparatively rare and usually larger than lymphocytes.

2. **Eosinophils**:
   - Granules are large and stain bright red or orange.
   - Typically, a bilobed nucleus is visible, aiding differentiation from neutrophils.

3. **Lymphocytes**:
   - Smaller, round cells with a large, dense nucleus occupying most of the cell volume.
   - Minimal cytoplasm, usually without granules.

4. **Monocytes**:
   - Largest among these cells, with an irregular or kidney-shaped nucleus.
   - Cytoplasm is abundant and may appear grainy or slightly vacuolated.

5. **Neutrophils**:
   - Multi-lobed nucleus (polymorphonuclear), with fine, neutral-staining granules.
   - Common in blood smears, helping distinguish them from rarer basophils or eosinophils.

For classification:

- **Mononuclear vs. Polynuclear**:
   - **Mononuclear**: Single, round or indented nucleus (Basophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes).
   - **Polynuclear**: Lobed or segmented nucleus (Neutrophils, Eosinophils).
